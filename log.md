### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### R1D1: January 3, Friday, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through \~30 more percent of Basic Javascript course on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** To easy for me, but apparently I have to pass it in order to get to the harder parts.
